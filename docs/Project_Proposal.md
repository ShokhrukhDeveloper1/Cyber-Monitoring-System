# Project Proposal  
## Cyber Attack Monitoring & Prevention System  

### 1. Problem Statement  

Modern web systems are frequently targeted by cyber attacks such as brute force attempts, suspicious traffic, and unauthorized access. Many small and medium systems do not have proper monitoring, logging, or automatic protection mechanisms. As a result, security incidents may go unnoticed or be detected too late.  

### 2. Project Goal  

The goal of this project is to design and implement a web-based cybersecurity monitoring system that can:  

- Detect suspicious activities in real time  
- Log security events securely  
- Automatically block malicious IP addresses  
- Provide an admin dashboard for monitoring and control  

### 3. Project Scope  

The system will include:  

- A secure login page for administrators  
- A monitoring dashboard  
- A page displaying detected attacks  
- A page showing secure system logs  
- Backend services built with ASP.NET Core  
- A SQL Server database for storing data  

### 4. Expected Outcomes  

By the end of the project, the system will:  

- Identify basic cyber attacks (e.g., brute force attempts)  
- Store security logs safely  
- Block dangerous IP addresses automatically  
- Provide a clear and usable admin interface  

### 5. Technologies Used  

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Backend: ASP.NET Core (C#)  
- Database: SQL Server  
- Version Control: GitHub
